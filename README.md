# Local Apollo Setup

This is an out-of-the-box working setup of Apollo/GraphQL that can be used for training purposes or as a boilerplate for your application.

# Installation Steps

This implementation should work as is without any further configuration needed:

1. Clone proyect
2. In root directory of project run `yarn`
3. Go to the "Run" tab on VS Code and click **RUN** (make sure "Launch Program" is selected on the dropdown)

That's it, after a few moments the server should be ready and you should have access to the playground on `http://localhost:4000`

# Troubleshooting

If you are running Windows make sure that the default shell selected on VS Code is `CMD`, if it runs `git bash` the launch process could fail.
